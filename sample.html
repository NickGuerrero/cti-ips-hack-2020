                                <p>AdoptAClassroom.org believes that every child should have access to the resources they deserve to succeed in school. Sadly, too often our nation’s educators have to use their personal funds in an attempt to give students equal access to education. The results from our 2020 Teacher Spending Survey highlight the fact that the need for teachers to spend their own money to do their job is increasing.</p>

                                <p>Since then, classroom needs have drastically changed. As one teacher responded, “Right now, there are so many unknowns for my classroom, all I know is that I cannot anticipate everything I need for the fall.” Teachers need funding to respond to current events in education. They need to be able to quickly access the materials they need most, and get them directly to students at home, or in the classroom.</p>

                    <p><strong>Harassment:</strong> Harassment includes but is not limited to offensive verbal or written comments related to the following: gender, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, social class, economic status, veteran status, sexual images, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing, photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate contact - physical or otherwise, and unwelcome sexual attention. Any action which makes an individual(s) feel uncomfortable in any sense may be qualified as harassment, and should be stopped immediately.</p>
                    <p>All participating members will be subject to the anti-harassment policy. This includes, but is not limited to: Participants, Sponsors, Judges, Moderators, Volunteers, Panelists, and CTI-IPS Hackathon Organizers.</p> 
                    <p>Any form of harassment that is not stopped immediately will lead to intervention by CTI-IPS Hackathon Organizers to intervene by any means necessary. Which may result in said participant(s) being disqualified from the event and will not be eligible for re-admission or qualify for any possible reimbursement.</p>
                    <p><strong>How to Report:</strong> If you are being harassed, please notify CTI-IPS Hacakthon event organizers immediately. We will be happy to assist in contacting authorities or local law enforcement to aid in reporting your harassment.

                    <h2>Hackathon Challenge Rules</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li class="p-formal">All work on a project should be done during the hackathon. You can't continue a project either.</li>
                        <li class="p-formal">You must be part of a registered team to submit. This includes registering for the event, joining a team, and confirming that team with the Hackathon staff on the day of the event. Team sizes are between 2-5, and can be made either before or at the event.</li>
                        <li class="p-formal">Teams should be made up exclusively of participants who are not organizers, volunteers, judges, sponsors, or in any other authoritive position during the event.</li>
                        <li class="p-formal">Teams can use libraries, frameworks, or open-source code in their projects. Working on a project before the event and open-sourcing it for the sole purpose of using the code during the event is against the spirit of the rules and is not allowed.</li>
                        <li class="p-formal">Teams must stop hacking once the time is up. However, teams are allowed to debug and make small fixes to their programs after time is up. e.g. If during demoing your hack you find a bug that breaks your application and the fix is only a few lines of code, it’s okay to fix that. Making large changes or adding new features is not allowed.</li>
                        <li class="p-formal">Teams can be disqualified from the competition at the organizers’ discretion. Reasons might include but are not limited to breaking the Competition Rules, behaving in a way that violates the code of conduct, anti-harassment policy, or other unsporting behaviour.</li>

                    <h2>Hackathon Judging Criteria</h2>
                    <p>On the day of the event, the topic of the Hackathon challenge will be announced. Until then, I recommend you get familiar with the way we're looking at submissions. Every submission is placed into one of the three categories:</p>

                    <h3>Desktop and Web Applications</h3>
                    <p>This category is for projects that are built for the desktop or on the web. Despite the difference between the two, this category is more broad, and allows for a lot of flexibility in project ideas.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li class="p-formal">As a more general category, there will be a wide range of projects, but once the topic is announced, it will help narrow down options.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Mobile Applications</h3>
                    <p>This category is for projects that are built primarily for mobile devices, i.e. apps.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li class="p-formal">This includes either Android or iOS. With the time limit, it's unlikely you'll get to develop for more than one system, so it's more important to finish than think about compatibility.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Command Prompt Only</h3>
                    <p>This category is for projects that operate solely on the command prompt, no graphical user interface allowed. Although a great beginner category, it also demands more focus on the core functionality of the project.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li class="p-formal">As the title implies, program must run only on the command prompt.</li>
                        <li class="p-formal">Ascii art and related libraries are allowed, however, please try to stick to libraries that are multi-platform.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Applies to all submissions:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li class="p-formal">There are no strict language requirements, however, we should be able to understand the project just by looking through the code. Common general purpose languages are safe choices.</li>
                        <li class="p-formal">Likewise, please document your projects well. We're going to have a lot of projects to look through, so the more we understand about your project, the more likely you'll get a top spot.</li>
                        <li class="p-formal">All projects will be submitted with a video and a GitHub repository. The video should be no more that 5 minutes and cover the functionality of your project, and the GitHub repository should have all code used.</li>
                    </ul>
